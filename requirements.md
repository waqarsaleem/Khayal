## Description
This project aims to develop hands-on experience with open source by building an open-source interactive graph editing and visualization tool (online).

## Interface
The product should allow user to:
* create graphs by adding nodes and edges
* edit the graph
* undo functionality
* select/remove node/edges 
* change nodes/edges positions interactively
* change layout interactively
* visualize graphs through different layout algorithms
* extract properties of graph
* load and export graphs
* change color/shape of nodes/edges interactively

# ?
* Gather a team.
* Wireframe: to see what our product will be look like? What functionalities are essential?
* Finalize the development environment
* Priorities the required functionalities
* Define versions


## Requirements
Below are the assorted requirements as of now.
1. Handle a graph of up to 100 vertices.
1. Handle a graph of up to 1M vertices.
1. Build a wire frame of the application.
1. Perform timing tests to optimize the run time.
1. Investigate layout alligators for graph visualization.
1. Choose the implementation language.
1. Implement GPU support.
1. Build a testing environment.
1. Incorporate CI/CD.
1. Investigate hosting options.
1. Finalize a development environment.
1. The achirecture should be pluggable: a user can add their own plugins
